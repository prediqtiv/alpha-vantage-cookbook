Thank you for considering contributing to Parallel Constitution. We look forward to your participation. We hope that sharing your experiences will benefit others who read and use our efforts.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## New Users

The first thing to do is to register a user name with [GitHub]( https://github.com/ ).

You will need to supply a username and email address and to create a password.

After you have registered you can go to your [GitHub settings]( https://github.com/settings/profile ). Here you can add a photo and update your bio. It's a good thing to add at least some data - especially a photo and a location. These help your friends remember and know that it is really you.

You may now start contributing to our project with a few small but very helpful efforts.

In the top right hand corner of this page: github-top-right-screen-capture.png

You will see the 'Watch' and 'Star' buttons

_note the [freeCodeCamp]( https://freecodecamp.com/ ) 'Watch' and 'Star' buttons at top right_

Please click both of these buttons for [Ladybug Tools on GitHub]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/ladybug-tools.github.io ). 

Clicking 'Star' makes you feel good - and it lets the world know there is interest in our project. Clicking 'Watch' means you receive an email when there is an issue. Any time you start getting too many messages, you may click this button again to update your preferences.


## Joining the Team

The next thing you can do is to request becoming a member of the organization. If you personally know a member then you might send them a request for an invitation. Anther way is to create an [issue on Ladybug Tools]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/ladybug-tools.github.io/issues ).

For further details see GitHub's [Managing membership in your organization]( https://help.github.com/articles/managing-membership-in-your-organization/ )



## Displaying Your Pride

Another very nice thing you may do is set your membership to 'public'.

Got to [Ladybug Tools People]( https://github.com/orgs/ladybug-tools/people )

![github-people-screen-capture.png]( https://cdn.glitch.com/8f4ee7c6-c279-4f9f-8598-a145f33d2ea6%2Fgithub-people-screen-capture.png?1499556745948 =600x100 ) 
_Member options for GitHub organizations_

Setting your membership to public helps new users see that they are joining a team and not just helping a particular individual. It also helps with your user name popping up as a suggested contact in GitHub issues and other useful places.

Now that you are set up as a user and a member, let us explore the ways you may contribute to this project... [TBD]
